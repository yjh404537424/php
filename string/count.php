$str ="\"Karen Daly, this is my bank card, and the password is 131224, you can use it to buy anything necessary.”

A few hours had passed, but Karen Daly was still thinking about what her new husband had said as he handed her a bank card before going out in the morning.

Honestly, she knew very little about her husband.

Apart from the fact that his name was Kevin Kyle, she knew nothing else about him, not even who his family members were.

Karen Daly did not know where she got the courage to get married to a man she had only met twice.

Ten days ago, with the help of Faye Reed, her best friend, Karen Daly met Kevin Kyle for the first time on a blind date.

She was not hopeful. After all, she had been hurt three years earlier, and she no longer had the right to be picky about others, but had to succumb to letting others pick her instead.

She was 15 minutes earlier on the day of the blind date.

Since she didn’t have any good qualities, she could only do better in other aspects, hoping to leave a good impression.

If she could marry a man that was suitable for her, she could also make her parents feel at ease.

The man came on time.

The man's suit and shoes were very formal, which made her feel how important he viewed this blind date, which gave her a good first impression of him.

His way of greeting was also very ordinary. \"Miss Karen Daly, Hello! I am Kevin Kyle.\"

It was a very ordinary sentence, but because his voice was very magnetic, it made Karen Daly feel unusually pleasant, leaving behind better impression than before.

After a brief chat, they exchanged their phone numbers and left.

Since Karen had been on many blind dates before, she did not take this blind date seriously.

She thought that this blind date would end up the same as those before. Unexpectedly, she received a call from Kevin Kyle two days later.

His voice was as polite as before, \"Miss Karen, are you free tonight?\"

That night, Kevin Kyle invited her to an Italian restaurant for dinner.

Karen Daly didn't like the awkwardness of a blind date. There spoke very few words in at the restaurant. During the meal, she felt a little cautious and she didn't eat much.

Originally, she wanted to find a reason to leave early. While she was hesitating, Kevin Kyle spoke first, \"Miss Karen, I have some time next Wednesday, how about we get our marriage certificate picked up then?\"

\"What, what certificate do you want?\" Karen Daly was shocked by Kevin Kyle's words.

\"A marriage certificate,\" he repeated in a serious tone. He did not sound like he was joking at all.

\"A marriage certificate?\" Karen Daly still did not believe what she had heard. She put her hand on her thigh and pinched it hard to make sure that she was not dreaming, then she looked at the man in front of her seriously.

Kevin Kyle had a pair of thick sword-shaped eyebrows, bright eyes, and a beautiful face. He was so eye-catching that others could spot him immediately in a crowd.

His expression and attitude were very serious, and he didn't look like an impulsive person. This was only the second time they had met, and he yet said he wanted to marry her?

Then, the man's deep magnetic voice arrived at her ears again. \"I thought that you were just like me. Going on a blind date with the objective to form a family, to get married and have children, and live an \"ordinary\" life.\"

\"Yes, I think so too, but after all, we have just met for the second time. Don't you think it's too fast?\" Karen Daly said. She wanted to have her own family, but she didn't expect it to be so hasty.

\"It is a bit too fast.\" Kevin Kyle continued with a calm look, \"After the first meeting, I went back and thought about it for two days. You have given me a good feeling. I personally feel that our personalities don't clash, so I want to have a try.\"

Karen Daly frowned slightly and was a little unhappy. \"In my opinion, marriage is not a trivial thing. Try? If this doesn’t work out, does it mean you want to...\"

Before she could finish, Kevin Kyle interrupted her, \"Miss Karen, we are all adults. Of course, we would never yearn for a love that does not even exist. We all know what we want.\"

Karen Daly did not answer and continued to stare at him.

On the surface, this man was calm and not flamboyant. He would be a good husband.

However, could she really hand over the rest of her life to this man whom she had only met twice?

Really?

Seeing that she was hesitating, Kevin Kyle added, \"Maybe it was impatient of me, to not have considered your feelings. If you think I'm suitable, you can go back and think about it. I'll wait for your call.\"

After returning home that day, Karen Daly had been thinking about it all night.

She admitted that some of her opinions were similar to those of Kevin Kyle's. For example, she also believed that there was no true love in the world.

After being deeply hurt, she no longer believed that there was love in this world.

After a sleepless night, Karen Daly called Kevin Kyle early the next morning and agreed to his so-called proposal.

In the afternoon, Karen Daly brought along her household registration book and went to register their marriage at the Registry of Marriages with Kevin Kyle.

When they collected their and walked out of the Civil Affairs Bureau together, she had a feeling that she could not explain.

It was said that for women, marriage is the mark of a new life, but now it seemed to be just so simple. All it took was 9 dollars for a certificate that now meant that Karen Daly legally belonged to Kevin Kyle.

Karen Daly then moved into Kevin Kyle's apartment.

Kevin Kyle had behaved with chivalry that night. He took the initiative to leave the main bedroom for her to rest alone, while he slept in another bedroom.

Karen Daly had never expected for Kevin Kyle to hand over his bank card to her before he went to work today.

They didn't even know each other that well. How could he be so sure with giving all his property to her?

\"Karen Daly, the reporters from the media are waiting inside. The directors and the new boss are coming soon. Why are you in a daze at this time?\"

The stern voice of the Public Relations Manager, Emma Wilson, interrupted Karen Daly's daydreaming. She quickly pulled back her thoughts and said with a straight face, \"Manager Wilson, I'm sorry, I'll pay attention.\"

Emma Wilson looked at Karen and said in a harsh tone, \"Karen, although you are an employee from the Sales department, your manager has sent you to assist with the Public Relations Department. You had better wake up and don't drag me down with you.\"

Karen Daly pursed his lips and nodded. \"Manager Wilson, I was just distracted. It won't happen again.\"

Emma Wilson looked at Karen Daly again and then looked away. She clapped her hands and called several employees who were also responsible for the reception over.

\"Everyone, try your best. We must hold today's press conference smoothly. We can't afford any mistakes.\" While speaking, Emma Wilson glanced at every employee.

\"Yes.\" The employees of the Public Relations Department, who were assigned temporarily to support this reception, responded in unison.

Emma Wilson's eyes finally fell on Karen Daly again. \"Karen, I heard that you are the top employee in the Sales Department. You will be with the new boss later and be responsible for him. You don't have to worry about other things.\"

Karen Daly nodded, but Madonna, another employee of the Public Relations Department, gloated and said, \"Karen, if our new boss is still single, would you take advantage of him?\"

It was actually easy to get close to the new boss, but everyone knew that it would be a difficult job. No one wanted to pick it up, so Karen Daly took the job.

Emma Wilson stared at Madonna with a straight face and said, \"What happens today will highly affect our future. Be serious.\"

After being scolded by Emma Wilson, no one made a sound. They took in a quiet breath and put on their best behavior.

It was not Emma’s fault that she was nervous. After all, this matter had come so suddenly.

Just as everyone had thought that everything was finally at peace in the company, the board of directors suddenly issued a statement saying that the boss wanted to have a new person take over the business.

However, this new-appointed big boss was very mysterious. The heads of various departments enquired about him through various means, but they could not find any information about him.

Karen Daly was usually not nosy. But even she could not help but stretch her neck to look at the entrance, wanting to see who this big boss was.

\"Yes, yes. All the directors and the new boss are here.\" The voice of the reception staff channeled from the walkie-talkie to the other employees.

Her colleagues subconsciously adjusted their clothes and stood respectfully in their positions.

Karen Daly followed closely behind Emma Wilson to welcome the mysterious boss that everyone had awaited for long time.

After a few steps, a tall man in a silver-gray suit walked elegantly towards the lobby, surrounded by several men in black suits.

At first glance, she was stunned.

The tall man in a silver-gray suit in front of the crowd was her newly married husband, Kevin Kyle!

\"Impossible!\" Karen Daly thought that it was an illusion. She immediately closed her eyes and shook her head.

But when she opened her eyes and looked again, the man's appearance did not change.

If it were someone else, she could have made a mistake, but this was her new husband. She couldn’t be wrong.

His features were as sharp as a knife, his height was exactly at 1.88 meters. He had a strong build, and walked with a discreet air of elegance.

No matter what this man did, he was perfectly the same as her new husband.

\"Kevin?\" Karen Daly stared at the man and subconsciously called out his name.

When he heard her voice, the man's gaze shifted to her.

Looking at his eyes, Karen Daly felt so nervous that she almost forgot to breathe.

She would never think that her \"ordinary\" newly married husband would become the new boss of her company.

She looked at him with her head buzzing, she felt as if she might explode.

The man's gaze lingered on her for a moment and then moved away, as if he didn't know her at all.

After what he just did, Karen Daly’s heart sank rapidly.

He was obviously Kevin Kyle, her new husband. Why did he look at her with such indifferent eyes?

After a while, various thoughts flashed through her mind.

The most possible scenario was that she was dreaming. It was an unrealistic dream.

Kevin Kyle had always been gentle and patient. He spoke and did things politely. He would never pretend that he didn't know her.

She pinched herself hard and twitched her mouth in pain, only to find that this was not a dream at all.

Since it was not a dream, there was another possibility. This man might have the same face as Kevin Kyle did, but he might be a completely different person.

Emma Wilson pulled Karen Daly aside and scolded her in a low voice, \"Karen, do you know what kind of occasion is this? What the hell are you doing?\"

Karen Daly was a little annoyed, as if she was rudely woken up from a dream.

Emma Wilson whispered again, \"Hurry and keep up.\"

Karen Daly nodded and quickly followed the new boss. She had concealed her emotions and faced the big boss who looked exactly like her new husband professionally.

Emma Wilson quickened her pace and caught up with the new boss and the others. She pushed open the door of the banquet hall for the reporters and said, \"Let's welcome all the directors and our new boss!\"

As Emma Wilson's voice fell, there was a fierce applause in the conference hall. Everyone stared at the entrance, waiting for the mysterious big boss to show up.

Karen Daly gasped quietly and followed closely behind the big boss. After the big boss was seated, she quickly handed over some documents.

Even though she had professional training, the fact that the company's new boss was actually her new husband, still shocked her too much. She trembled, and two pieces of paper from the documents in her hand fell to the ground.

Karen Daly was about to bend down to pick up the files, but Kevin Kyle picked them up before she did. Then he whispered in her ear, \"Wait for me at home tonight.\"

If Kevin Kyle had not said these words, Karen Daly would still treat him as a man who only looked exactly like her husband. As soon as he said this, Karen Daly was mind-blown, she was dumbfounded and forgot what to do.

Fortunately, the attention of the reporters was not on her, so she had some time to adjust her emotions.

The reporters did not notice her. However, the sharp-eyed employees of the Public Relations Department did not miss this little episode.

The Public Relations Department was well prepared for the event and all other departments cooperated well. Kevin Kyle was charismatic enough to take on the press, so the conference went very well.

As soon as the new boss and the other directors left, Madonna rushed over and said, \"Karen, the way you \"accidentally\" dropped the documents just now was great - you successfully attracted our new boss's attention.\"

Karen Daly frowned slightly, she turned to Emma Wilson and said, \"Manager Emma, I'll go back to the Sales department after finishing my work here.\"

Looking at Karen Daly turn away from her, Madonna was so angry that she stomped her feet. \"She ignored me! She just ignored me! Why is she so arrogant?\"

Emma Wilson glared at Madonna and said, \"Don't just stir up trouble all day long. If you continue to make trouble, you will be the next one to leave. If you are capable enough, just do your job well. As long as you climb to a higher position than she does, you will be qualified to be arrogant as well.”

Madonna glared at Karen Daly's back as she walked away. She gritted her teeth and replied, \"Understood, cousin.\"

Karen Daly returned to the Sales department office and heard her colleagues discussing about the new boss.

Everyone had something to say, as if they knew the new boss very well.

When her colleague, May Lily, saw her, she hurried over and said, \"Karen Daly, you're so lucky to be the first one working side by side with the boss.\"

Karen Daly smiled faintly and said, \"It's all just work. Even we were side by side, it is still just work. If you think you can work well with the boss, you can ask our manager to send you to work for the boss in future.\"

May Lily quickly waved her hand and said, \"Although our new boss is handsome and charming, we don’t have the guts to approach him, given his eyes and charisma.\"

\"The new boss will be coming over for a routine inspection. Go back to your positions and do what you’re supposed to!\" Sunnie Olsen, the manager of the sales department, walked into the office, reprimanding his subordinates.

The new boss was coming to inspect!

Hearing this news, Karen Daly could not help but gulp in fear. She was so nervous that her heart was about to jump out of her throat.

She still needed some time to digest the fact that her new husband, Kevin Kyle, was the new boss of the company. She was not ready to face him for a while.

The other colleagues all returned to their seats except for Karen Daly, who was still standing there in a daze. Sunnie Olsen looked at Karen Daly and asked, \"Karen, don’t you have anything else to do?\"

\"I'm fine.\" Karen Daly came to her senses and quietly clenched her fists. She quickly returned to her seat and turned on the computer to check a client's information.

After a while, the elevator bell rang, and Kevin Kyle, surrounded by a group of people appeared before Karen again.

Fortunately, Kevin Kyle just came to say a quick hello to the employees of the department. After listening to Sunnie Olsen's quick report, he led the group of people away.

After Kevin Kyle left, the department became noisy again. Even Sunnie Olsen, who was usually very serious, could not help but gossip along with everyone.

The only topic they talked about was whether this handsome boss was unmarried or married.

Karen Daly listened to their discussion and did not say anything. She was thinking if this group of women had known that her name was written as his spouse on the boss's marriage certificate, would she be skinned alive by them?

This tense work day had finally passed. Karen Daly packed up to leave after all her coworkers had already left.

When she finished her work during the day, what kind of mentality should she have to face Kevin Kyle at night?

Karen Daly really didn't know what to do. She didn't even know if she should go back to her \"home\" with Kevin Kyle.

Outside the building, Karen Daly habitually turned to the right towards entrance B of the subway. After walking for a while, she remembered that she was now living with her new husband.

Kevin Kyle's apartment was not too far from Tech Valley. Three stops by bus about half an hour by foot would get her there.

Karen Daly looked at the time. It was only five o'clock now. Anyway, she hadn't figured out how to face Kevin Kyle, so she chose to walk home. She could slowly think about what had happened between them.

Down the valley, Karen Daly decided to buy some vegetables and meat from the fresh supermarket nearby. No matter how big one’s problems were, filling one’s stomach was still a first priority.

She didn't know what Kevin Kyle liked to eat, so she took out her phone and wanted to call him to ask, but she was worried that it was not convenient for him to answer the phone, so she put it back in her bag.

After picking up the ingredients, she carried them home.

As she approached the apartment’s elevator, she saw a familiar figure. He was facing the elevator and standing very straight. He wore a light gray suit with great taste.

Kevin Kyle’s figure was very well built. From afar, he seemed so good looking.

Karen Daly still didn't understand why had such an outstanding man, who was the boss of a big company, would go on a blind date, and that she was the lucky girl who was chosen.

\"You're back.\" Karen Daly walked over and tried to greet him casually.

\"Yes.\" Kevin Kyle looked back at her. He didn’t change his expression, he was still a little indifferent.

Karen Daly gave him a faint smile and stood beside him.

She glanced at him and felt that he seemed to be a little different today. She couldn't figure out what exactly was different.

She glanced at him from the corner of her eye. It turned out that he wore a pair of glasses today, with a golden frame, it made him look calm and more restrained.

Karen Daly sighed silently in her heart. This man had again only spoken a few words when meeting her today. He was usually very soft-spoken. She didn't know what to do, she wanted to bridge the gap between them.

Now that she knew his shocking true identity, she didn't know how to approach him.

While she was thinking about this, Kevin Kyle suddenly stretched out a hand towards her, but she took a small step back subconsciously to keep a distance from him.

\"I’ll carry those for you.\" he said calmly. He was not angry although she had kept her distance. Instead, he casually took the bag in her hand.

Karen Daly felt her face burning hot. He had just wanted to help her carry the bag, but she was thinking too much.

She looked down at Kevin Kyle's strong arm, carrying the large bag effortlessly. A warm feeling hit her heart.

She thought optimistically, \"Even if there is no love, even if he is the boss of the company, as long as the two of them could devote themselves to managing this marriage, it would be fine.\"

The two of them entered the elevator, and no one spoke a word during the trip up the elevator.

After returning home, Kevin Kyle put the things in the kitchen and said lightly, \"I don't know how to cook. I'll have to trouble you tonight.\"

\"You can do your work. Leave the cooking to me.\" Karen Daly put the bag away, took off her coat and put on her apron.

\"Thank you,\" He said lightly.

\"You're too polite,\" Karen Daly forced a smile, which felt a little awkward.

They were already husband and wife, but the way they got along felt like two strangers.

She felt that it was reasonable for a wife to cook for her husband, but his way of talking to her created a distance between them.

She thought that even if their marriage was not based on love, their interaction shouldn’t be that distant.

She didn't think much about it anymore. She turned around and went to the kitchen. She quickly washed the rice and put it into the pot. Then she sorted out the vegetables and washed them...

After a while, from the corner of Karen Daly's eye, she saw a tall figure standing at the door of the kitchen. She turned back and asked, \"What's the matter?\"

\"If you need any help, please tell me,\" Kevin Kyle stood rigidly. His tone was still calm, but it sounded a little distressed.

\"Wait a minute. I'll be done soon!\" Karen Daly poked her head out and looked at the clock hanging on the wall in the living room. It was already 7:30 p.m. and he might be starving.

She thought to herself, “I must come back quickly after work tomorrow. I should make the dishes earlier so that he can eat straightaway when he comes home.\"

No matter who Kevin Kyle was, this marriage was her own choice. She must try her best to make it good.

\"I...\" Kevin Kyle moved his thin lips but said nothing. His eyes showed a hint of incomprehensible depth beneath the golden glasses. He stared at Karen Daly's back and thought for a few seconds, then he turned and walked to the study room.

In the past three years, Karen Daly had rented a room for herself and lived alone. She was very good at making some home-cooked dishes. Soon, two dishes and a soup were served on the table.

\"Kevin, it's time to eat.\" Karen Daly knocked on the door of the study room carefully and gently pushed the door open when she did not hear a reply.

Kevin Kyle was making a phone call in the study. He said, \"Take care of these things. You don't have to report everything to me.\"

After that, he hung up the phone immediately. The moment he looked up, he met Karen Daly's eyes and asked coldly, \"What's the matter?\"

\"Time to eat,\" Karen Daly smiled and did not dare to look at him.

\"I’ll be there in a second.\" His tone was indifferent as usual.

The two of them sat opposite each other, eating their meal tensely. Neither of them spoke to break the silence. For a moment, the atmosphere seemed to be extremely boring.

Karen Daly moved her lips several times to find some topics to talk about, but she swallowed back her words after she saw Kevin Kyle's indifferent expression.

After dinner, Kevin Kyle offered to wash dishes for her, and Karen Daly did not refuse. Since was willing to share the burden of these chores with her, she was happy to let him do so.

It could be seen from Kevin Kyle's clumsiness that he had never done these things before.

But it was true. It was impossible for a boss of such a big company to do such trivial things such as washing dishes.

Clank—

Hearing the crack of a porcelain bowl in the kitchen, Karen Daly stood up immediately and walked over.

What she saw was Kevin Kyle holding a bowl in his hand and staring blankly at the broken porcelain pieces on the ground.

\"Let me do it.\" Karen Daly walked over and wanted to take the bowl from Kevin Kyle's hand.

\"No, I'll do it.\" Kevin Kyle stretched out his hand and his tone did not change.

\"Kevin, actually...\" Karen Daly looked at Kevin Kyle's firm eyes and could not say anything. She nodded and left the kitchen to let him continue.

Although they were legally a couple, Kevin Kyle was still a man that Karen Daly was not familiar with.

She wanted to know him more, to know everything about him, she was trying her best to be a good wife.

However, with a personality like his, could she really get close to him like how she had planned when they had gotten married?

Karen Daly sat down in the living room, picked up the remote-control, turned on the TV, she randomly put on a news channel.

While watching the TV, she occasionally turned his head to look in the direction of the kitchen. Through the glass door, she saw Kevin Kyle carefully cleaning bowls and cutlery.

She secretly sighed in her heart, how could a man look so good while washing dishes.

Perhaps Karen Daly's gaze were too obvious, Kevin Kyle looked back as well. Their eyes met, and Karen saw the slight coldness in Kevin Kyle's eyes. But he then let out an impeccably polite smile.

As she was caught looking at him, Karen Daly's face turned slightly red, and then she returned a polite smile.

Karen Daly turned her eyes back to the TV screen, thinking about Kevin.

This man was so confident at work, and even looked so good while washing dishes. When would she ever see him make a fool of himself?

After tidying up the kitchen, Kevin Kyle returned to the hall and saw that Karen was in a daze. He stared at her delicate face and said after a few seconds, \"Karen.\"

\"Ah...\" Karen said as she listened to his soothing voice, she found it very pleasant. For a moment, she felt her face burning hot.

Kevin Kyle sat down on the sofa beside her. \"I have something to discuss with you.\"

\"Okay.\" Karen Daly replied. She also wanted to have a good talk with him and take this opportunity to make things clear.

Kevin Kyle's deep gaze swept up and down her, and then he slowly said, \"Karen, today at the company...\"

\"We’ll have a separate work and personal life. I understand that. In fact, I don't want to let people gossip behind our backs because of our personal relationship.\" Kevin had not finished yet, but Karen interrupted him.

She had worked hard in this company for three years to have her achievements today. She wanted to continue climbing up the corporate ladder on her own. She didn't want anything to change because of Kevin Kyle.

His face was calm, but his eyes flashed an imperceptibly beneath his glasses. \"I didn't mean to hide my identity. I did not know how you would feel about me when I saw you during the event, so I did not announce anything to the public, but I didn't mean to hide it on purpose.\"

\"I know,\" Karen Daly nodded and said, \"My work life and personal life is always separate. I don't want to bring my personal life to work.\"

It was their own business that she and Kevin Kyle had gotten married. Karen Daly felt that there was no need to announce it to the people in the company.

On one hand, she did not want her job to be affected. On the other hand, she was not sure how far she could go with Kevin Kyle.

Looking at Karen’s firmness, Kevin Kyle paused and said, \"Did you tell your family about our marriage?\"

Karen Daly shook her head, she did not want to talk about her family.

\"I have just taken over Innovative Tech, and I have some things to deal with in person. If you don't mind, after all pressing matters have been attended to, I would like to go with you to visit my father-in-law and mother-in-law,\" He said calmly, as if he had expected Karen to have mentioned this matter to her family.

\"No.\" Karen Daly refused immediately, but then felt that it was inappropriate, so she hurriedly explained, \"I have had some issues with my family. I haven't contacted them for a long time. Let's talk about it later.\"

Family?

Every time she thought of this word, Karen Daly felt a dull pain in her heart, it made her a little breathless.

Three years ago, that home was no longer her home, and she could never go back.

\"Karen.\" Kevin Kyle called her name in a deep voice and said, \"You are no longer alone. You have me.\"

Kevin Kyle's tone was dull, but because of his pleasant voice, it carried a different feeling.

This sentence was obviously not romantic, but it made Karen Daly's heart full of inexplicable feelings.

Although she gritted her teeth and had gradually overcome the pain over the years, some late nights, she would still feel sad and silently shed tears while thinking of it.

\"Karen.\" After a long silence, Kevin Kyle spoke again, \"We are already husband and wife. I sincerely want to spend the rest of my life with you.\"

Kevin Kyle suddenly said this, and Karen was stunned again. Looking up at him and into his sincere eyes, she also said, \"I am determined to live with you for the rest of my life.\"

Kevin Kyle stared at her beautiful face, paused for a few seconds and said, \"Karen, can you promise not to break up with me no matter what happens?\"

\"Yes!\" Karen Daly nodded heavily. \"I will try my best to be a good wife.\"

She had also thought that they should not break up so easily. And now, Kevin had said so, and this made her feel at ease.

After chatting with Kevin Kyle, she felt much more at ease.

Kevin Kyle went back to the study. Karen then cleaned up the room and went to the bathroom to take a bath. After her bath, she sat in front of the dressing table and blew her hair dry. Just when her hair had dried, Kevin Kyle came in.

He also took a shower and put on a white bathrobe, revealing a small piece of supple smooth skin on his chest. His hair was still dripping with water, which followed the lines of his body and disappearing into the white bathrobe.

Karen Daly's face suddenly blushed.

\"You must be tired. Go to sleep early.\" Kevin Kyle suddenly said. His voice was low and magnetic, which made Karen’s heart beat inexplicably.

Kevin Kyle did not intend to leave. Did he mean to sleep in the same room tonight?
